- API calls to chatgpt to build software apps
- Two types of LLMs
    - Base LLM 
    - predicts next word based on text training data
- Instruction Tuned LLM
    - Tries to follow instructions, Fine tune on instructions and good attempts at following those instructions
    - base llm + good attempts at instructions to follow (Fine Tune)
    - use RLHF -> Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
    - Helpful, Honest and Harmless
- Tactics to work with ChatGPT
    - clear and specific instructions
    - give model time to think
- iterative Prompt Development
    - Idea -> Implementation (code/data) -> Experiment result -> Error Analysis
                (Prompt)
    - Try something
    - Analyze where result does not give what you want
    - Clarify instructions, give more time to think
    - Refine prompts with batch of examples 
- summarizing
    - generate summary of text block
    - better word to use -> more accurate
- inferring
    - analysis on text -> sentiment, extract name, so on -> need diff models for each task
    - Good use case - assign labels for unlabelled data
    - information extraction
    - infer topics -> what topics are about ?
    - Zero Shot Learning -> determine topics in news article without giving any labels
- tranforming
    - tranform input to diff format ex. diff language, proof reading for grammer mistakes, html to json format
- expanding
    - expand shorter text to longer text (email, essay)
- temperature
    - degree of randomness in response of model
    - temp 0 most likely word (most predictle response - reliable)
    - high temp -> choose words less likely & diverse response (variety)
- chatbot
    - conversation model with llm
    - custom chatbot
    - take multiple messages as input and provide next output
    - role -> system, user and assistant (chatgpt)
    - system -> overall instruction (Sets behavior) then messages exchange between user and assistant
- summary
